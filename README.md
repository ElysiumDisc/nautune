# Nautune 🎵🌊

Poseidon's cross-platform Jellyfin music player. Nautune is built with Flutter and delivers a beautiful deep-sea themed experience with smooth native audio playback, animated waveform visualization, and seamless Jellyfin integration.

## ✨ Highlights

## 🎨 Key Components

### Now Playing Bar (`lib/widgets/now_playing_bar.dart`)
- **Waveform Progress Strip**: Tinted Jellyfin waveform with a synthetic fallback when the server can't provide one
- **Scrub Anywhere**: Drag the waveform or slider to seek instantly
- **Mini Controls**: Play/Pause/Stop/Skip buttons always accessible
- **Tap to Expand**: Opens the full-screen player

### Library Screen (`lib/screens/library_screen.dart`)
- **Albums Tab**: Grid view with infinite scroll support, album artwork
- **Artists Tab**: Full artist browser with discography navigation
- **Search Tab**: Search albums inside the selected library, displaying artist attribution and year
- **Favorites Tab**: Recent and favorited tracks in a list
- **Playlists Tab**: Your Jellyfin playlists with track counts
- **Bottom Navigation**: Material `NavigationBar` mirrors the tab order for quick access on mobile and desktop

### Audio Player Service (`lib/services/audio_player_service.dart`)
- Manages playback lifecycle and queues
- Prioritises direct-play URLs with adaptive fallback to Jellyfin transcoding
- Auto-saves position every second and restores on launch
- Configures native audio session for optimal performance

### Playback State Persistence
- Saves: current track, position, queue, album context
- Stored in `SharedPreferences` as JSON
- Restores automatically on app launch
- Survives app restarts and force-closes

## 🔧 Development

## 🌐 Building for Other Platforms

- **iOS**: Builds produced by Codemagic CI. **CarPlay plugin implemented!** See `plugins/nautune_carplay/` for integration.
- **Windows**: `flutter build windows` (requires Windows machine with VS 2022)
- **macOS**: `flutter build macos` (requires macOS with Xcode)
- **Web**: `flutter run -d chrome` for dev, `flutter build web` for production
- **Android**: Not currently a focus; no Android SDK required for development

> **Development Tip**: Keep your Linux environment Snap-free. Use official Flutter tarball or FVM. Codemagic handles iOS builds.

### 🚗 CarPlay Support

Nautune includes a custom Swift CarPlay plugin under `plugins/nautune_carplay/`:
- Simple, focused car-friendly UI
- Now Playing screen with album art
- Playback controls (play/pause, skip)
- Library browsing support
- iOS Media Player integration

See [`plugins/nautune_carplay/README.md`](plugins/nautune_carplay/README.md) for setup instructions.

### 🚧 In Progress / Planned
- [ ] Full player screen with lyrics display
- [ ] Enhanced search across all content types
- [ ] Equalizer and audio settings
- [ ] **Sorting options** (by name, date added, year for albums/artists)
- [ ] Cross-platform stability improvements (Windows, macOS, Android)
- [ ] **FFT optimization**: Currently uses flutter_audio_capture which may need platform-specific permissions
- [ ] CarPlay library browsing and advanced features

## 🐛 Known Issues

- **Audio Streaming**: Using direct download URLs (`/Items/{id}/Download`) for best GStreamer compatibility on Linux
- **Audio Capture Permissions**: FFT visualization requires microphone/audio capture permissions on iOS/Android
  - On **Linux**: May need PulseAudio/ALSA loopback module for system audio capture
  - On **iOS**: Requires microphone permission (will fall back to silent bars if denied)
  - On **Android**: Requires `RECORD_AUDIO` permission
- **Gapless Playback**: Currently uses simplified approach; consider `just_audio` package for true gapless on all platforms
- Infinite scrolling needs backend pagination support
- **Waveform**: Now uses REAL FFT analysis but falls back to silent if audio capture unavailable
- CarPlay testing requires physical device or iOS Simulator with CarPlay window
- Lock screen media controls not yet implemented

## 📝 Development Guidelines

1. **Follow Flutter/Dart lints**: Enforced by `analysis_options.yaml`. Run `flutter analyze` before committing.
2. **Write tests**: Add unit/widget tests for new features. Run `flutter test`.
3. **Keep UI declarative**: Centralize styling in `lib/theme/nautune_theme.dart`.
4. **Jellyfin integration**: Keep all API logic in `lib/jellyfin/`. Expose state via `NautuneAppState`.
5. **Graceful error states**: Show loading spinners, error messages, and retry buttons.
6. **Document complex flows**: Add inline comments for non-obvious logic.
7. **Commit frequently**: Use descriptive commit messages. Sync via SSH.

## 🤝 Contributing & Collaboration

1. **Feature branches**: Work on branches, open PRs against `main` with screenshots/demos
2. **Coordinate platform changes**: Discuss desktop shortcuts, CarPlay hooks early
3. **Code reviews**: All PRs require review before merge
4. **Testing**: Ensure builds pass on Linux before pushing
5. **Codemagic**: Note iOS build considerations in PR descriptions
